Explanation of Folders:

    assets/:
    Stores static files like images, fonts, and icons used throughout the application.

components/:
Contains reusable UI components.

    common/: For highly generic components that can be used across different features (e.g., Button, Modal).

blog/: For components specific to the blog functionality (e.g., BlogPostCard, CommentForm).
layout/: For structural components defining the application's layout (e.g., Header, Footer).

contexts/:
Holds React Context providers for managing global state (e.g., user authentication).
hooks/:
Stores custom React Hooks for reusable logic (e.g., useAuth for authentication-related logic).
pages/:
Contains top-level components representing individual pages or routes of the application (e.g., HomePage, BlogPostDetailPage).
services/:
Encapsulates logic for interacting with external APIs or services (e.g., blogApi.js for fetching blog posts).
styles/:
For global styles, CSS variables, and mixins.
utils/:
Houses utility functions or helper modules that don't belong to a specific component or feature. 
App.js:
The root component of your React application.
index.js:
The entry point of your application, responsible for rendering the App component.

This structure promotes modularity, makes it easier to locate specific files, and enhances code reusability, which are crucial for building a scalable and maintainable blog application.
